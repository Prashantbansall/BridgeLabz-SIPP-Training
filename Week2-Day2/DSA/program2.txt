Q2. Attendance Marker

CREATE 2D ARRAY attendance[30][30]   // 30 students, 30 days

METHOD markAttendance(student, day, status)
    attendance[student][day] = status   // 1 = Present, 0 = Absent

METHOD dailySummary(day)
    count = 0
    FOR each student
        IF attendance[student][day] == 1
            count++
    PRINT "Day day: count students present"

METHOD monthlySummary(student)
    total = 0
    FOR each day
        IF attendance[student][day] == 1
            total++
    RETURN total

METHOD defaulterList()
    FOR each student
        presentDays = monthlySummary(student)
        IF presentDays < 22   // 75% of 30
            PRINT "Student student is defaulter"

EXAMPLE RUN
    Mark Day 1: Student 1 = Present, Student 3 = Absent
    Check Day 10 summary → count 1s in column 10
    Check Student 5 monthly total → count 1s in row 5
    Generate defaulter list
