During the **first two weeks** of BridgeLabz SIPP Training, I gained a strong foundation in Java programming:

- Understood core syntax, data types, and how Java programs are structured  
- Learned how control flows work using conditions and loops  
- Worked with arrays and matrices to handle data collections  
- Practiced writing and reusing methods for modular programming  
- Mastered string creation, manipulation, and formatting  
- Explored Java exception handling, its types, and real-time error management  

> 💡 These sessions provided practical exposure through assignments and helped improve my logical thinking and Java fluency.

## 🧠 Summary: What I Learned (23 June – 02 July)

From **23 June to 2 July**, I explored the core principles of **Object-Oriented Programming** in Java. Here's what I gained:

- Applied real-world modeling using **classes and objects**
- Reused and extended logic using **inheritance**
- Secured data with **encapsulation**
- Applied **polymorphism** for flexible method handling
- Designed using **abstract classes and interfaces**
- Learned to read and create **UML diagrams** for better architecture visualization

> 💡 These concepts strengthened my ability to write clean, modular, and scalable Java applications using industry-standard object-oriented practices.

## 📙 Workshop & Scenario-Based Coding (8 July – ongoing)

📁 Branch: [`Workshop`](https://github.com/Prashantbansall/BridgeLabz-SIPP-Training/tree/Workshop)

### 📅 8 July – [Vehicle Rental Application Scenario](https://github.com/Prashantbansall/BridgeLabz-SIPP-Training/tree/Workshop/Vehicle-Rental-Application-Scenario)

**📝 Objective:**  
Create a rental system that supports renting different types of vehicles (Bike, Car, Truck) to customers and calculates rental fees based on the number of days.

#### ✅ Concepts Used:
- **Class Design**: Vehicle (base), Car, Bike, Truck (subclasses), Customer
- **Constructors**: Initialization logic for vehicle-specific rates
- **Access Modifiers**: `protected` fields to allow subclass inheritance
- **Interface**: `Rentable` interface for rental operations
- **Operators**: Applied in rent calculation logic (`baseRate × days ± extras`)

#### 💡 OOP Concepts Demonstrated:
- **Abstraction**: `Rentable` interface abstracts rental calculation logic
- **Inheritance**: All vehicle types inherit from a base `Vehicle` class
- **Polymorphism**: `calculateRent()` is implemented differently by each vehicle
- **Encapsulation**: Fields are kept private and accessed through setters/getters
