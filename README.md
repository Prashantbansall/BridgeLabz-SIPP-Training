## 🧠 Summary: What I Learned (10 June – 21 June)

During the **first two weeks** of BridgeLabz SIPP Training, I gained a strong foundation in Java programming:

- ✨ Understood core syntax, data types, and how Java programs are structured  
- 🔀 Learned how control flows work using conditions and loops  
- 📊 Worked with arrays and matrices to handle data collections  
- 🔧 Practiced writing and reusing methods for modular programming  
- 🔡 Mastered string creation, manipulation, and formatting  
- ⚠️ Explored Java exception handling, its types, and real-time error management  

> 💡 These sessions provided practical exposure through assignments and helped improve my logical thinking and Java fluency.
