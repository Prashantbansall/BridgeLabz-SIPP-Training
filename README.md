#### 📌 Problem Statement:
Given a BST of `n` nodes (each node contains a unique product ID) and a list of `q` product IDs to search, write a function that:
- Returns **"Available"** if the product exists.
- Otherwise, returns the product ID that is **closest in value** to the one searched.

🔁 If two values are equally close, return the **smaller one**.

#### ✅ Input:
- Integer `n` — number of products in the catalog
- `n` integers — product IDs inserted into BST
- Integer `q` — number of queries
- `q` integers — product IDs to be searched

#### 🎯 Output:
For each query:
- Print `"Available"` if the product ID exists
- Or print the **closest ID** in the BST

#### 🧠 Constraints:
- `1 ≤ n, q ≤ 10^4`
- Product IDs: `1 ≤ ID ≤ 10^9`

#### 🧪 Example:

**Input:**
