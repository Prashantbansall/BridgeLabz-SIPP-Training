### 📅 8 July – [Vehicle Rental Application Scenario](https://github.com/Prashantbansall/BridgeLabz-SIPP-Training/tree/Workshop/Vehicle-Rental-Application-Scenario)

**📝 Objective:**  
Create a rental system that supports renting different types of vehicles (Bike, Car, Truck) to customers and calculates rental fees based on the number of days.

#### ✅ Concepts Used:
- **Class Design:** Vehicle (base), Car, Bike, Truck (subclasses), Customer
- **Constructors:** Initialization logic for vehicle-specific rates
- **Access Modifiers:** `protected` fields to allow subclass inheritance
- **Interface:** `Rentable` interface for rental operations
- **Operators:** Applied in rent calculation logic (`baseRate × days ± extras`)

#### 💡 OOP Concepts Demonstrated:
- **Abstraction:** `Rentable` interface abstracts rental calculation logic
- **Inheritance:** All vehicle types inherit from a base `Vehicle` class
- **Polymorphism:** `calculateRent()` is implemented differently by each vehicle
- **Encapsulation:** Fields are kept private and accessed through setters/getters

- **Step 3:** Traverse from right to left, ensuring higher hunger still gets more packages
- **Step 4:** Sum the final package array to get the result

#### 📦 Input:
- `n` – number of people
- `hunger[]` – hunger levels of each person

#### 📤 Output:

### 📅 10 July – [E-Commerce Product Catalog](https://github.com/Prashantbansall/BridgeLabz-SIPP-Training/tree/Workshop/E-Commerce-Product-Catalog)

**📝 Objective:** 
Implement a searchable product catalog using Binary Search Tree (BST) with search and suggestion capabilities.

#### 🛒 Scenario:
You are building a product catalog for an e-commerce platform where each product has a unique ID. The catalog is implemented as a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** where nodes store product IDs.

You need to support two operations:
1. Efficiently **search** if a product is available.
2. **Suggest** the closest product ID if the searched ID does not exist.

#### 📌 Problem Statement:
Given a BST of `n` nodes (each node contains a unique product ID) and a list of `q` product IDs to search, write a function that:
- Returns **"Available"** if the product exists.
- Otherwise, returns the product ID that is **closest in value** to the one searched.

🔁 If two values are equally close, return the **smaller one**.

#### ✅ Input:
- Integer `n` — number of products in the catalog
- `n` integers — product IDs inserted into BST
- Integer `q` — number of queries
- `q` integers — product IDs to be searched

#### 🎯 Output:
For each query:
- Print `"Available"` if the product ID exists
- Or print the **closest ID** in the BST

#### 🧠 Constraints:
- `1 ≤ n, q ≤ 10^4`
- Product IDs: `1 ≤ ID ≤ 10^9`

#### 🧪 Example:

**Input:**
n = 5,
product IDs = [10, 5, 20, 2, 7],
q = 2,
queries = [6, 20],

**Output:**
5,
