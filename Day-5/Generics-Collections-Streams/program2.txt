Q2. Employee Bonus Distribution Engine

CLASS Employee
    PROPERTIES: name, department, rating, baseSalary
    CONSTRUCTOR(name, department, rating, baseSalary)

MAIN:
    DECLARE List<Employee> employees = new ArrayList<>()

    // Example Employees
    e1 = new Employee("Alice", "IT", 5, 50000)
    e2 = new Employee("Bob", "IT", 3, 40000)
    e3 = new Employee("Charlie", "IT", 2, 30000)
    e4 = new Employee("David", "Finance", 4, 60000)
    e5 = new Employee("Eva", "Finance", 5, 70000)

    employees.addAll([e1, e2, e3, e4, e5])


    // Step 1: Group employees by department
    deptGroups = employees.stream()
                          .collect(groupingBy(Employee::getDepartment))


    // Step 2: For each department, calculate bonus pool
    FOR EACH (department, empList) IN deptGroups.entrySet():
        totalSalary = empList.stream().mapToDouble(emp -> emp.baseSalary).sum()
        bonusPool = totalSalary * 0.10

        totalRatings = empList.stream().mapToInt(emp -> emp.rating).sum()

        PRINT "Department: " + department
        PRINT "  Bonus Pool = " + bonusPool

        // Step 3: Distribute proportionally
        FOR EACH emp IN empList:
            share = (emp.rating / totalRatings) * bonusPool
            PRINT "   " + emp.name + " â†’ " + share
